Installation guide for Object Creator


<Steps>
### Install MariaDB
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Do not use XAMPP
</Callout>
Install the latest stable version of [MariaDB](https://mariadb.com/downloads/community/), if you don't have it already.
 
### SQL file
<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Do not use phpMyAdmin
</Callout>
The SQL code should install automatically. However, if it doesn't, you can manually run the following code using [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/).

```sql copy
CREATE TABLE `uniq-objects` (
    `id` LONGTEXT NULL DEFAULT NULL COLLATE 'utf8mb3_general_ci',
    `data` LONGTEXT NULL DEFAULT NULL COLLATE 'utf8mb3_general_ci'
) COLLATE='utf8mb3_general_ci' ENGINE=InnoDB;
```

### Install Dependecies
Download and install the following dependencies:
- [oxmysql](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql)
- [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib)
- [ox_target](https://github.com/overextended/ox_target)
- up-to-date [server artifacts](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/)
 
Download dependencies and add them to your `resources` folder.
### Add to server.cfg
Find your `resources` folder, inside create a new folder named `[uniq]` if one doesn’t already exist, move the asset from [Keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net/login?return_url=/assets) into `[uniq]`, and add `ensure [uniq]` at the end of your `server.cfg` file. Make sure that all dependencies listed above are started before our asset.
