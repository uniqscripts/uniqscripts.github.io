### Add to server.cfg
Find your `resources` folder, inside create a new folder named `[uniq]` if one doesn’t already exist, move the asset from [Keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net/login?return_url=/assets) into `[uniq]`, and add `ensure [uniq]` at the end of your `server.cfg` file. Make sure that all dependencies listed above are started before our asset.
