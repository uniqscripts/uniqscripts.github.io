# FiveM asset escrow errors

## You lack the required entitlement to use X

Make sure that your server's license key is owned by the same [keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net/login?return_url=/) account that owns the [asset](https://keymaster.fivem.net/login?return_url=/asset-grants). If it is on the same account, restart your server. If not, transfer the asset to the same account as your server's license key. Please note that you can only transfer assets once.

## Failed to verify protected resource X

This error means that files were corrupted during the download. Most times this happens because you use FileZilla, which doesn't work well with encrypted files. Try using [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) instead.

## Error parsing script @Y in resource X: @Y: syntax error near ``<\1>``

This error means that your server artifacts are outdated. Update to the [latest recommended version](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/).
